This is a Nuxeo 5.5 plugin that solves a problem related with serial workflows.

Let's suppose a serial workflow with three validators:

 Validator 1
 Validator 2
 Validator 3

When validator 1 validates workflow, it is validator 2 turn. If validator 2 refuses validation, the turn goes back to validator 1 to validate again.

If validator 1 validates, default Nuxeo's features is to give turn to validator 3, when it should be validator's 2 turn.

This plugin solves this issue.
